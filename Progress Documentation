ROADMAP: Keeping abreast with the state-of-the-art

SUPERVISED LEARNING
1. Understand and implement Neural Networks thoroughly. Especially back propagation. This includes studying the state-of-the-art 
  (i)   optimization techiniques like ADAM, RMSPROP 
  (ii)  Regularization techniques like Droput and finetuning/debugging neural networks. 
  (iii) Which activation functions works best and why
  (iv)  preprocessing techniques like how should and should not be the weights in Neurel network be initialized

2. Understand and implement CNN

3. Understand and implement RNN: LSTM and GRU
   (i)Implemented LSTM as a character-level language model

4. Understand and implement GANs

5. Understand and implement AutoEncoders

6. Understand and implement NLP fundamentals like word2vec, ngram models and familiarize with nltk and other libraries.

7. How to effectively employ GPUs for training purposes.

6. Write an application.
It is expected to learn and discover new tools for efficient and easy implementation of the above along the way. This includes coming
across frameworks such as Keras, Theano, Tensor Flow, Lua, scipy, Pandas, numpy, Chainer.
