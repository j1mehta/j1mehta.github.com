ROADMAP:
1. Understand and implement Neural Networks thoroughly. Especially back propagation. This includes studying the state-of-the-art 
(i)   optimization techiniques like ADAM, RMSPROP
(ii)  Regularization techniques like Droput and finetuning/debugging neural networks. 
(iii) Which activation functions works best and why
(iv)  preprocessing techniques like how should and should not be the weights in Neurel network be initialized

2. Understand and implement CNN
3. Understand and implement RNN
Implemented LSTM as a character-level language model
4. Understand and implement GANs
5. Understand and implement AutoEncoders
6. Write an awesome application.
It is expected to learn and discover new tools for efficient and easy implementation of the above along the way. This includes coming
across frameworks such as Keras, Theano, Lua, scipy, Pandas, etc.

This document will be regularly updated providing more concreteness about particular topics under each major subpoint.
